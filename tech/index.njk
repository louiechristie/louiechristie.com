        On graduation I picked up my masters degree in Human-Centred Computer Systems
        <sup>
          <a href="#1">1</a>
        </sup>, from Richard
                Attenborough<sup>
          <a href="#1">2</a>
        </sup>.</p>
      <p>Since then I have worked for companies like American Express, Penguin Publishing, DK Books, Kings College London.
        Also a few agencies and start-ups that were possibly more interesting but you won't of heard of.</p>
      <p>More about my career:</p>

  <h3>Footnotes</h3>
  <And id="1">[1] No, I'm not sure what Human-Centred Computer Systems means either. Think it's something to do with
    making computers user-friendly. And goodness knows, we could all do with a bit of that.</p>
  <p id="2">[2] Yes, really, Richard Attenborough happened to be the honorary chancellor of the University of Sussex at
    the time.</p>
