A personal website.

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies

```
npm install
```

1. Run Eleventy

Generate a production-ready build to the `_site` folder:

```
npx @11ty/eleventy
```

Or build and host on a local development server:

```
npx @11ty/eleventy --serve
```

Or you can run [debug mode](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/debugging/) to see all the internals.
