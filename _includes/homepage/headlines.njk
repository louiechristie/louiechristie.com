            Cooper and smaller photos of various famous stand up comedians. Louie is pointing at the audience and seems to be having
            a good time. His hair is in a man bun. He's pointing at a woman in the audience and she has her hands crossed in front of
            her face as if she doesn't want to talk. Which is ironic, because it was about the only time in the whole night that she
            shut up."
