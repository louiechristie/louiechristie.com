            <h3>The actually impressive thing about this photo is...</h3>
            <p>
              At the time I lived 4 hours drive from the surf, had a wetsuit with holes in it, didn't own a car...</p>
            <p>Or a
                                                                                                                surfboard.
            </p>
            <p>
              The surf around Britain doesn't get that good very often, and it's bloody cold.
            </p>
            <p>
              It's not Hawaii.
            </p>
            <p>
              I got to surf like this by being resourceful, tenacious, and being a computer geek with no girlfriend at the
              time.

            <sub>Photo @ AJ Hackett, Cairns, Australia</sub>
            <p>I was in Cairns - the extreme sports capital of
                                                        Australia.</p>
            <p>
              The day before I'd been whitewater rafting.
            </p>
            <p>
              The day after I did a skydive.
            </p>
            <p>People ask 'which was scarier, skydive or bungee jump?'
            </p>
            <p>
              Bungee jump by far.</p>
            <p>In a skydive it's all so fast and you're up up-in-the-air looking down at the clouds. It's kind of
              surreal.
            </p>
            <p>
              But the bungee jump felt very real as I climbed the tower, slowly, floor by floor, thinking: 'I'm going to jump off this
              bloody thing.'
            </p>
            <p>
              As I jumped, I saw the blue horizon above the trees in the forest, and the world paused for a moment, like when a
              cartoon coyote runs off a cliff...
            </p>
            <hr/>
            <p class="fast">Then the ground rushed towards me, my heart pumped, a primal scream came out of my chest that I don't
              remember making, and my life literally flashed before my eyes.
            </p>
            <hr/>
            <p>
              ...It felt amazing after I'd survived the first bounce.
            </p>
            <p>
              And I boinged around merrily laughing until they eventually lowered me into the rubber dinghy in the lake
              below.
            </p>
            <p>
              I was so pumped on adrenaline that that evening I got drunk on about half a schooner of beer.
            </p>
            <p>
              I think I've been boinging around merrily in my head ever since.
            </p>
            <p>I was 19 years old at the time, travelling the world, between school and university, which is what adventurous
              British kids do if their parents are doctors, lawyers or accountants.
            </p>
            <p>The idea is you have all the adventure in that one year and then settle down to a boring office job forever, and give
              up on life.</p>
            <p>It's not a mentality that I ever much subscribed to. But that's another story...</p>
