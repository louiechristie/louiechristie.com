        <h3>The actually impressive thing about this photo is...</h3>
        
        <p>
          At the time I lived 4 hours drive from the surf, had a wetsuit with holes in it, didn't own a car...</p>
        <p>Or a
                                                                  surfboard.
        </p>
        <p>
          The surf around Britain doesn't get that good very often, and it's bloody cold.
        </p>
        <p>
          It's not Hawaii.
        </p>
        <p>
          I got to surf like this by being resourceful, tenacious, and being a computer geek with no girlfriend at the
          time.

          Bungee Jumping

        <p>I was in Cairns - the extreme sports capital of Australia.</p>
        
        <p>The day before I'd been whitewater rafting.</p>

        <p>The day after I did a skydive.</p>
        <p>People ask 'which was scarier, skydive or bungee jump?'
        </p>
        <p>
          Bungee jump by far.</p>
        <p>In a skydive it's all so fast and you're up up-in-the-air looking down at the clouds. It's kind of
          surreal.
        </p>
        <p>
          But the bungee jump felt very real as I climbed the tower, slowly, floor by floor, thinking: 'I'm going to jump off this
          bloody thing.'
        </p>
        <p>
          As I jumped, I saw the blue horizon above the trees in the forest, and the world paused for a moment, like when a
          cartoon coyote runs off a cliff...
        </p>
        <hr/>
        <p class="fast">Then the ground rushed towards me, my heart pumped, a primal scream came out of my chest that I don't
          remember making, and my life literally flashed before my eyes.
        </p>
        <hr/>
        <p>
          ...It felt amazing after I'd survived the first bounce.
        </p>
        <p>
          And I boinged around merrily laughing until they eventually lowered me into the rubber dinghy in the lake
          below.
        </p>
        <p>
          I was so pumped on adrenaline that that evening I got drunk on about half a schooner of beer.
        </p>
        <p>
          I think I've been boinging around merrily in my head ever since.
        </p>
        <p>I was 19 years old at the time, travelling the world, between school and university, which is what adventurous
          British kids do if their parents are doctors, lawyers or accountants.
        </p>
        <p>The idea is you have all the adventure in that one year and then settle down to a boring office job forever, and give
          up on life.</p>
        <p>It's not a mentality that I ever much subscribed to. But that's another story...</p>
