**[Watch Elephant Boy on filmaka.com (3 mins)](https://www.filmaka.com/films.php?page=currentsubmissions&contest=265&film_id=18820)**

I just discovered that this short film I worked on has won the first round of a filmaka.com competition.  Instead of the usual working behind the scenes I was in front of the camera on this one.

We had a story outline but no script.  We improvised the film using Meisner and Impulse Company techniques.  Some people have made [kind comments](https://www.filmaka.com/films.php?page=currentsubmissions&contest=265&film_id=18820) about my apparently understated acting.  I can mostly attribute this to training with [Remy Bertrand](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GkWWfmU55x4) at [Imprology](http://imprology.com/) (Far Games), [Pat Kelman’s](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pat_Kelman) direction and to being heavily sleep deprived at the time.

The short film went on to win the ReelTube category at the 2009 ReelHeART International Film Festival.
