This was a university computer 3D animation project back in 2001. The brief was to create a toy advert. I chose to spoof the Hot Wheels toy cars and create a toy car chase loosely influenced my the movie ‘The Italian Job’.

<iframe title="Hop Wheels" src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/1076750917?dnt=1&amp;app_id=122963" width="192" height="144" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin"></iframe>

The toy car chase takes place on a dining room table via household objects like a book, kitchen roll and a ruler.

The video was created using Houdini for 3D animation and Adobe Premier for editing.

Update 2026: The tools have moved on, but it’s interesting to look back at what was achievable by a computer science student in 2001.
