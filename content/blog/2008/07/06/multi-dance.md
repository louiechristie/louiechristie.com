I have a masters degree (MSc) in making computers user friendly. This is a video I made demonstrating my masters degree project (3 mins).

Multi Dance, 2006

The project was a video game called Multi Dance that teaches children multiplication tables. It was designed to be foot controlled using a dance mat. The idea was to use technology and exercise to make learning fun. Maybe I was on to something because now Nintendo are doing similar things with Brain Training and the Wii Fit.

The video is slightly embarrassing, but in my defence I made it in 2006, on my home PC with no budget, borrowing a camera from the university and using free editing software from the internet. Thankfully, since making this video I’ve learned professional film-making techniques like using a tripod, fading in music and not wearing national health service glasses.

Created as part MSc masters degree project in human-centred computer systems at Sussex University, tutored by [Dr Judith Good](http://www.sussex.ac.uk/profiles/174826).

Music by [Dan Franks of the Freestyle Funk Collective](http://www.freestylefunkcollective.co.uk/)
