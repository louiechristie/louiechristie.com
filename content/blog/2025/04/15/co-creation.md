Email to Fergal (not his real name):

Hi Fergal,

I’ve been meaning to say to you, the last \[Virtual Reality Health App Project\] meeting went really well…

I loved that we followed a _co-creation_ process where everyone contributed and lots of post-it notes were involved. I loved that it was a _cross-functional team_ (I’ve _italicised_  tech industry/academia buzz words I’ve used in this email to indicate they are not just weird terms I’ve made up.) I loved that is was a _cross-functional team_ comprising service users, a medical professional – yourself, a software developer and a project manager/facilitator type person (I forget the exact job title she gave herself.)…

I loved that we did _paper-prototypes_ and that there were lots of post-it notes, stationary and arts/crafts materials. Apparently that was my idea. I must admit I don’t remember making the suggestion in the past, but I’m glad I did, it’s the sort of thing I recommend. Doing _paper-prototypes_ and generally scribbling on paper before writing any computer code were heavily advocated in my MSc in Human-Centred Computer Systems at University of Sussex – and I can see why – I thought it went very well.

So I’m much more optimistic about the project and I applaud you for having the courage to drop some of the previous work and to _iterate_, make a _course correction_, and be _agile_. All _buzz words_ they use in industry but industry rarely actually do.

… a pleasure to be involved in this research and development project, and I’m excited to see what comes next.

Best wishes,

Louie Christie
