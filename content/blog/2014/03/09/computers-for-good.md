Introducing the Raspberry Pi, a computer the size of a deck of cards, cheap enough at £40 to give away to children and designed to help with teaching programming.

I grew up playing around on a ZX Spectrum computer at home and a BBC Micro at school.  I remember programming the computers using the BASIC programming language and at aged ten writing a BASIC program as part of a school history project.

These days PCs hide programming away and kids are less inclined to delve under the hood.  I hope a new generation will grow up programming on the Raspberry Pi, like I did on the BBC Micro.

I’ve been playing around with a Raspberry Pi and as a project I set it up as a Linux web server with a WordPress blog on it.
